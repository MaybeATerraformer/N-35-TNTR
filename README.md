The N-35 is a theoretical **TRImodal** thermonuclear engine that aims to facilitate faster travel to Mars and beyond. In a *cooling system* similar to the [RS-25](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rs25_engines_handout_031016.pdf), the N-35 uses LH2 to cool the nozzle and the outside of the reactor.

# About 
The N-35 was designed to be a more powerful nuclear engine than a bimodal engine, having greater thrust and ISP. In addition, it does not need many radiators to function properly due to its cooling through LH2. The propulsion modes that give the name TRImodal to this engine are the following: *LH2* propulsion; *LH2 + LOX* propulsion; *LH2 + LOX + Kr (or Xe)* propulsion.
